## 2026-07-28 — Vault is a capability broker; identity is multi-user from commit one

**Refines the 2026-07-27 vault entry rather than superseding it.** Three
capabilities arrived separately — AI, live data, key distribution — and are one
shape: **vault brokers what a travelling file structurally cannot hold** (a
secret, a private network, an authority). That definition is the test for what
belongs in vault and what does not.

Settled:

- **Vault configuration lives in the SHELL, never the document** — a second
  plaintext `#bento-vault` block under the same splice contract. In the document
  it would travel with the content and leak an internal hostname to anyone
  emailed a deck. "Export for outside" strips it, visibly.
- **A minted shell points its update channel at the vault.** Not a choice:
  `serializeWith(shell, doc)` (`kernel/src/save.ts:322`) re-splices into a
  freshly fetched shell and discards everything else, so shell config survives an
  update only if the update comes from the vault. Needs a visible "return to
  upstream" escape so a defunct vault cannot freeze former employees' files.
- **Dual signatures.** Canonical runtime = the file minus `#bento-doc` and
  `#bento-vault`; its sha256 must match upstream's signed manifest, and the vault
  signs its config BOUND to that hash. A compromised vault can then redirect
  endpoints but cannot ship modified editor code. Build in v1 — unaddable later.
- **Documents carry a query NAME, never query text.** The vault maps names to
  parameterised statements defined by an admin. Otherwise every deck anyone opens
  is an exfiltration tool against the database.
- **A bound document always carries its last known values.** A vault connection
  refreshes data, never supplies it, or "works with no network" falls by another
  route.
- **A vault refresh is a COMMIT, not a derivation.** Linked charts derive
  identically on every replica today; a fetch does not (two replicas fetching at
  different moments get different rows). Extend `scripts/test-sync.ts` first.
- **Archival is reinstated; backup stays cut.** Different products. Copying bytes
  is solved; being able to OPEN them in ten years is not, and a Bento archive
  renders itself and stays machine-readable as plaintext JSON with no vendor in
  the loop. Vault produces the archive shape; restic moves it.

**Who it serves, re-argued and resolved.** Three of the capabilities (live data,
retention archive, private release channel) are properties of a DEPLOYMENT rather
than a person, so the org case got stronger; the case against did not weaken,
because it rests on maintenance surface — every org-shaped pillar implies
multi-user identity, and that is what a single maintainer carries indefinitely.
Resolution: this decides what we PROMISE, not what we build — broker, index and
archive serve one user and fifty identically. Ship single-user and promise
nothing organisational, **but design the identity model multi-user from the first
commit**: per-user query authorisation and spend attribution cannot be retrofitted
without migrating every deployed vault. The gate for building organisational
features is a real stated requirement, not a count of pillars.

## 2026-07-27 — Thumbnails: plain markup plus a parser-blocking remover, NOT `<noscript>`

**Supersedes the 2026-07-26 entry below** on the one point of where the preview
lives. Everything else in it still stands: written at save time, replaced never
appended, `PREVIEW_BUDGET` tiers, and above all **encrypted decks get no
preview**.

`<noscript>` renders only where scripting is DISABLED, and iOS satisfies
neither half of that. Probed with a page that is red by default, turns green
from an inline script, and carries a blue `<noscript>`, the iOS thumbnailer
renders **RED** — it runs no script AND does not render `<noscript>`. So the
feature worked in Finder and macOS QuickLook and did nothing on the platform it
was built for; every deck in Bento Tray stayed a dark box.

That same gap is the fix. A renderer that runs no script still renders ordinary
markup, and every real reader does run script — so the preview ships as a plain
`[data-bento-preview]` element with a **parser-blocking inline remover**
immediately after it. The thumbnailer keeps the preview (it never runs the
remover); the reader never sees it (the script executes before the browser
paints). Measured: at removal `document.readyState` is `"loading"` and
`performance.getEntriesByType('paint')` is EMPTY — zero frames containing the
preview were ever presented. Not a fast flash; no flash.

The 2026-07-26 entry chose `<noscript>` to avoid exactly that flash, and
accepted "a thumbnailer that does run scripts sees no preview" as the trade.
Both halves turned out to be wrong about iOS, and the replacement costs neither.

**A QLThumbnailProvider extension does not work and should not be retried.** It
registers correctly (`pluginkit` shows `SDK = com.apple.quicklook.thumbnail`)
but its process never launches: iOS uses its own generator for `public.html`
and does not consult third-party extensions for types it already handles.
Likewise `NSURLThumbnailDictionaryKey` via `UIDocument.fileAttributesToWrite`,
which is accepted and then silently dropped for local files — inspecting the
xattrs afterwards finds only `com.apple.lastuseddate`.

`previewIsSafe` is now MORE load-bearing, not less: the preview lands in the
live DOM rather than sitting inert inside `<noscript>`, so the refusal that
keeps a script tag out of it protects the page and not just the file structure.
`shell-gate.mjs` gained two source assertions — that the remover is emitted at
all, and that it sits immediately after the preview, since anything between
them is markup a browser could paint first.

## 2026-07-27 — bento/vault is the ORG service point, and the AI broker is what forces it

**Supersedes the 2026-07-25 "personal server" entry.** Vault is not a personal
document library. It is the **service point for a group of people and their
documents**, self-hosted on hardware that group owns.

The reframe came from subtraction. Of the five promises in the old entry, four
were met or taken while it sat unbuilt: mobile reach went to `bento/tray` plus
any existing File Provider (iCloud Drive, Dropbox), sharing went to the collab
relay (the file IS the capability), per-device version history went to
`kernel/src/autosave.ts`, and plain file sync was never ours. What survived
personally was **search alone**, and it has since been narrowed by measurement:
Spotlight indexes rendered HTML text, so the `#bento-doc` script block is
invisible to it — but the save-time preview is ORDINARY MARKUP now (the
thumbnails entry above), and markup indexes. Measured 2026-07-28 with
`mdimport -d2 -t` on a deck saved from the current shell: the whole title slide
comes back in `kMDItemTextContent`, and a token planted on slide two does not.
**Page one is already searchable for free; the unmet need is FULL TEXT.** One
real problem — now a smaller one — does not need a personal server.

**The AI broker is the pillar that makes vault necessary rather than nice.** A
self-contained document travels, so it can never carry a model credential — that
is emailing your API key to everyone you share the deck with. `localStorage` is
per-device, and under tray it is per-DOCUMENT (the origin is
`bento-tray://<sha256 of path>`, `EditorViewController.swift`), so it degenerates
into configuring a key per deck. The only place a credential can live once and
serve a whole library is a server the group runs. **In-app AI is architecturally
impossible without something vault-shaped**, and the same index serves both
search and retrieval. Points a local model (Ollama on the same box) at the
library without anything leaving the network, which is the existing README claim
made real.

**SSO gates distribution, never the file.** Once someone holds the bytes they
open them forever, offline, with no server — that is the product, not a bug. SSO
can gate access to the vault and the distribution of decryption keys (the
`bento/enc` envelope and the owner→invite→member chain already exist for this).
Revocation is therefore FORWARD-ONLY: a revoked member keeps what they already
downloaded, exactly as `collab-design.md` already documents for devices. Say this
before an enterprise security review discovers it.

**The org profile deletes most of the hard design.** NAT traversal,
hole-punching, WebRTC, the dead-drop and the portable relay twin all exist to
serve one case: a personal laptop asleep behind a home NAT. A company vault is a
box on a network with a hostname and a certificate, reached directly. So
`relay-design.md` steps 2–5 are NOT v1, and neither are the equivalent vault
steps.

Corollary worth stating plainly: the org vault **is** a custody service, and that
is correct — central custody is the point of centralising. The personal vault
explicitly was not. Those were two products wearing one name; we are building the
org one.

**New invariant — AI is additive, never load-bearing.** Every app stays fully
functional with no vault and no model, the same rule as "vault is optional". If
an AI feature ever becomes required to edit, `PLATFORM.md` §1 is gone.

**Sequencing: the org deployment is the DESTINATION, not the first build.**
Architecturally this costs nothing — a single-user vault IS the org vault with
one user: same index, same key chain, same broker. Build that, design toward
multi-user, promise neither.

**Licence:** the runtime stays MIT (`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` is embedded in every
saved file, so copyleft on the shell would attach to every document a user
emails). Vault is a separate repo with its licence chosen at commit #1. Never
relicense slides.

## 2026-07-26 — File-manager thumbnails: a `<noscript>` render of page one, written at save time

**Decided:** 2026-07-26. Kernel zone (`kernel/src/save.ts`), so it binds every
Bento app; the drawing is per-app (`slides/src/preview.ts`).

**The problem.** Thumbnailers render a document's HTML but do not run its
JavaScript, so every Bento file thumbnailed as the same dark box — correctly,
because before the runtime boots every deck *is* the same bytes plus the boot
splash. Confirmed on iOS, and confirmed that the iOS-side escape hatch does not
exist: an image attached via `UIDocument.fileAttributesToWrite` under
`NSURLThumbnailDictionaryKey` is accepted and then silently dropped for local
files (only `com.apple.lastuseddate` survives on disk). **The fix has to live
in the file.** So `serializeBody` now writes a static rendering of page one
into the shell on every save, and it fixes every platform at once with no
native extension anywhere.

**`<noscript>`, not "render it and let JS remove it".** The obvious design —
always paint the preview, have the runtime delete it at boot — flashes page one
in front of every reader on every open, for as long as the 600 KB payload takes
to inflate. `<noscript>` has exactly the semantics wanted: its contents are
rendered only when scripting is off, which is precisely the audience.
Empirically the DOM proves it, not just the spec — with scripting on the host
node has **zero element children** (its content is one raw text node) and a
bounding box of 0×0, so there is nothing to flash, nothing in layout, nothing
for print or present to exclude. The cost is that a thumbnailer which *does*
run scripts sees no preview — i.e. today's behaviour. A regression is not
possible, only an improvement.

**Scaling: `transform: scale(calc(min(100vw, <aspect>vh) / <width>px))`.**
CSS Values 4 length-over-length division yields the plain `<number>` `scale()`
needs, so the whole page scales as one unit and every inline px the renderer
emitted is left alone. **`<svg viewBox><foreignObject>` was tried first and does
not work**: Chrome renders it correctly, QuickLook's WebKit does not
(absolutely-positioned children disappeared, content scaled non-uniformly), and
QuickLook is the renderer this feature exists to serve. Verify changes here
against `qlmanage -t -s 640 -o <dir> <file>` — the real macOS thumbnailer, and
the only honest test. Chrome's `--blink-settings=scriptEnabled=false` suppresses
`--screenshot` entirely in Chrome 150; drive `Emulation.setScriptExecutionDisabled`
over CDP instead.

**Encrypted decks get NO preview — the load-bearing rule.** A plaintext
rendering of page one beside a `bento/enc` envelope hands over the title slide,
usually the most disclosive page, and does it invisibly. `previewAllowed()`
checks the in-memory password flag AND re-parses the body as an envelope,
because those fail independently. Removal of any existing preview is
UNCONDITIONAL and happens before that decision, so a deck that gains a password
loses its preview on the next save.

**Shell furniture, not format.** Nothing enters `#bento-doc`; no format field
is added; old files open unchanged; an app that registers no provider (spaces)
saves as before. The preview is replaced, never appended — `capturePristine()`
snapshots the file as loaded, so the clone already carries the previous save's
copy.

**Budget: 64 KB** (`PREVIEW_BUDGET`, slides/src/model.ts), ~10% of the shipped
shell. Measured: starter deck 25 KB (2.6% of the file); a page-one chart 11 KB;
a table 16 KB; a page with a 2.5 MB photograph degrades to 1.7 KB. Over budget,
page one re-renders with raster payloads replaced by tinted boxes; over it
again, a title card. Downscaling a hero photo instead would be
better and was NOT done: image decode is async and `serializeWith`/
`serializeFile` are synchronous (update.ts, `window.bento.serialize()`), so an
async provider is a kernel API change of its own.

Guards: `scripts/test-preview.ts` (encryption veto + the refusal to emit markup
carrying a script tag or `</noscript>`), and `scripts/shell-gate.mjs`, which
now also proves a preview-carrying file satisfies the splice contract and
asserts both rules are still wired into the save path.

## 2026-07-26 — A language pack lives in the FILE and nowhere else

No browser-local install. A "keep it on this computer" option (localStorage)
was **built and then removed**, because `localStorage` is scoped per ORIGIN
and that is fatally misaligned with how Bento is used: the download comes from
`bento.page` (an https origin) and the file is then opened from disk (a
`file://` origin). A language added on the website was therefore GONE the
moment the user saved the deck and reopened it locally — the exact journey the
product encourages, and "I added Korean and it vanished" is not a bug a user
can diagnose.

One home also matches the platform: the file *is* the software, so a language
belongs to the deck. The trade — adding a language requires saving the file —
is stated plainly in the UI ("Added when you next save") rather than hidden.
Adding is staged on click and written on the next save because on browsers
without File System Access, writing on click means silently downloading a
second copy of the user's deck.

Corollary: anything that remembers pack *content* outside the file
reintroduces this. Viewer *preferences* (locale, reduce-motion) stay
browser-local on purpose; that asymmetry is deliberate. Details:
`docs/i18n-packs.md`, `slides/src/packs.ts`.

## 2026-07-26 — The pack carrier is generic; pack POLICY is not. This is not a plugin system.

The kernel mechanism is already extension-agnostic and should stay that way:
`registerShellBlocks` / `readShellBlocks` (`kernel/src/save.ts`) carry
arbitrary typed blocks in the shell and know nothing about languages, and
`registerUpdatePrepare` (`kernel/src/update.ts`) is a generic "refresh
version-bound extras" hook. Signature verification and hash pinning are being
made generic in the kernel too (branch `claude/i18n-pack-verify`). Reuse all
of that freely.

**Do not generalize the policy.** Language packs are DATA and their worst case
is bounded — a tampered or stale pack shows wrong or English words. That bound
is why degrade-per-string, keep-on-refresh-failure, and auto-refresh on update
are the right rules *for packs*.

Anything carrying CODE is categorically different: unbounded failure (it would
hold the document, the file handle, and the collab keys), and it breaks the
property that makes self-update trustworthy — that the shell only ever runs
bytes from a signed release. Such a thing would need its own policy (pinned at
install, never auto-refreshed) and must not inherit the pack rules by reusing
the pack machinery.

So: reuse the carrier and the crypto; do not treat "we have packs" as evidence
that a plugin system is designed or wanted. It is not.

## 2026-07-26 — Side-loaded artifacts: sign the index, pin the bytes, fail closed

Language packs are fetched over the network, so they get the **same two-step
the app shell's own update already gets**: an envelope signed with the release
key (`{payload, sig}`, ECDSA P-256 / SHA-256) whose payload pins each
artifact's `sha256`, and a download that is accepted only if its bytes hash to
that pin. Signature over the pin, pin over the bytes. **No second key and no
second trust root** — `PUBLIC_KEY_JWK` in `kernel/src/update.ts` is it.

The mechanism lives in the kernel (`verifySigned`, `fetchPinned`) because it is
the same for anything side-loaded; the *policy* stays in the app
(`slides/src/packs.ts`). Keep that boundary: the kernel helpers verify BYTES,
they do not decide what is safe to use. Packs are DATA with a bounded failure
mode (wrong words on screen), which is why a pack that fails a refresh is kept
at its existing version rather than dropped. Anything side-loaded that ever
carries CODE needs stricter policy — pinned at install, never auto-refreshed —
and must not inherit the pack rules by reusing the same fetch.

**Fail closed, no legacy path.** An unsigned or unpinned index yields no
listings at all. Nothing is published yet, so there is no permissive fallback
to keep — and one added later would mean whoever answers for the channel picks
the strings in the UI.

**A pack already inside a file is NOT re-verified** (`readPacksFromShell`). It
was verified at the door, and once spliced it carries exactly the trust the
document does — anyone who can rewrite that block can rewrite the checking
code too. Re-verifying would need the network at boot, which breaks offline
use. Proof rig: `node scripts/test-packs.ts` (throwaway key, real crypto).

## 2026-07-26 — Language packs are published under a SIGNED INDEX, separate from the manifest

Amends the "Signing and release" paragraph of `docs/i18n-packs.md`, which said
the update manifest would gain a `packs` array. It does not.

`release.mjs` emits the packs and signs **one index** over all of them at
`releases/slides/packs.json` — the same `{payload, sig}` envelope, the same
offline key, and literally the same signing code as the manifest (extracted to
`scripts/sign-payload.mjs`). Each listing pins its pack's `sha256`; individual
packs are not separately signed. Clients verify the index once, then hash each
download against its signed hash.

Why not inside the manifest: shipped files ignore a manifest that is not
strictly newer than themselves (downgrade-replay protection), so pack hashes
carried there could never be corrected **between** app releases — and a fixed
translation is not a new app version. A separate index is re-issuable any day,
and `manifest.json` keeps meaning exactly one thing: here is the app shell.
Signed code and signed data stay two artifacts.

Still one key, still local-only signing, and `publish-site.mjs` now gates the
index the way it already gates the shell (indexed pack missing, hash drifted,
or packs staged with no index = refuse to publish). Details and the exact
payload shape: `docs/i18n-packs.md` §"Signing and release"; `scripts/sign-packs.mjs`.

## 2026-07-25 — i18n: a bundled core of 9 languages, everything else a signed pack

The 7 non-English catalogs cost **115,572 B** of the shell even after key-once
packing — more than any dependency, and an English-only shell is 28.8%
smaller. But we want *more* languages, not fewer. So: **bundle a core, ship
everything else as signed downloadable packs.**

- **Bundled (9):** the existing 8 (en, ja, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, es, fr, de, it)
  plus **Portuguese**. Nothing regresses for current users; Portuguese is
  added because Brazil has a real English-proficiency gap and it is in the
  cheapest cost tier.
- **Everything else:** a pack, signed with the existing release key and
  released centrally alongside each app release, fetched only on explicit user
  action and spliced into the file.

**No further languages get bundled by default** — demand declares itself
through contributions (#17 offers Korean), and a pack can be revised without
cutting an app release.

Measured facts worth not re-deriving: cost is **~14 KB per language regardless
of script** (CJK is the *cheapest* — 2.6× the bytes per character but a third
of the characters). Simplified↔Traditional conversion on the fly does **not**
pay: only 43.3% of characters match, because the difference is vocabulary
(软件/軟體) not glyph form, and deflate already recovers the genuine redundancy.
Rank candidate languages by the **English-proficiency gap in the segment that
uses this tool**, not by speaker counts — which is why Hindi is not in the core
despite 610M speakers.

Full design, risks and status: **`docs/i18n-packs.md`**. The risk that will
ship broken if ignored: **self-update must carry packs forward** — `update.ts`
re-splices the document into a *new shell*, and packs live in the shell.

## 2026-07-25 — Every PR gets human review before merging to main (for now)

At this stage of development the maintainer reviews **every** PR before it
lands on `main`, including agent-authored ones. No auto-merge. The point is
visibility into what the agents are actually producing while the multi-agent
workflow is still being shaken out — the cost is throughput, and that is
currently the right trade.

Supporting config, already in place: `main` is branch-protected with one
required approval, and CI (`validate`) is a **required status check**, so a red
build cannot merge. Admin bypass stays enabled for the maintainer.

### FUTURE ACTION — revisit when review becomes the bottleneck

When PR volume outgrows one reviewer, consider auto-merging **app-zone** PRs on
green CI. If that happens, these paths must **always** require human review
regardless, because a bad merge is either silent or catastrophic:

- **`kernel/src/`** — every app depends on it.
- **`slides/src/sync/`, above all `crdt.ts`** — convergence bugs are silent and
  corrupt documents. The rig is necessary but not sufficient: it only generates
  short strings, which is why it missed the large-text stack overflow (#47).
- **`server/`** — one bad deploy breaks live collaboration for everyone at
  once, and there is no per-user rollback.
- **`scripts/release.mjs` / `sign-release.mjs` / `keygen.mjs`** — the signing
  and release path.
- **Anything touching the `#bento-doc` splice contract or the update-manifest
  shape** (`PLATFORM.md` §2, §6) — these brick files already on users' disks.

Do not enable auto-merge without that exclusion list encoded somewhere
enforceable, not just written down here.

## 2026-07-24 — Naming: the platform is `bento`, the mark is `bento/.`, all lowercase
Settled after working through the whole namespace. **Do not reopen these** —
each rejected candidate was rejected for a specific reason, recorded below.

- **Platform: `bento`** (lowercase). Not "Bento Box", not "Bento Suite" — the
  bare word is the family, and `bento/<app>` reads as members of it.
- **Wordmark: `bento/.`** — the trailing dot stands for the platform (the apps
  complete the slash). This is a MARK, not a name: `/` is a path separator and
  is illegal in filenames, URLs, package names and social handles, and
  punctuation is disregarded for trademark purposes. Anywhere a name must be
  stored or typed, it is `bento`.
- **Casing: lowercase everywhere**, brand and machine alike. This deliberately
  collapses the usual split (`Docker` the brand / `docker` the command)
  because the lowercase form is already the file's own identity — `doc.type`
  is `bento/slides`, the MIME type is `application/bento+json`.
- **Apps:** `bento/slides` (shipped), `bento/spaces` (Notion/notes-like),
  `bento/dash` (spreadsheet + tables + dashboards — absorbs what would have
  been a separate database app), `bento/vault` (document library / personal
  storage). A word-processor app is planned; **`bento/folio` is the proposed
  name, NOT yet confirmed** (alternatives considered: draft, prose, write —
  `pages` and `docs` are unusable, being Apple's and Google's).

**Rejected, with reasons:** `box` — the natural collective noun, and Box, Inc.
is a cloud-storage company; keep it as an informal collective at most.
`base` — retired once dash absorbed tables; also reads as "database", which
this platform does not have. `bits` — generic, tonally wrong for an editorial
brand, and pushes search toward snack food. `page`/`pages` — reserved: it is
the best name for a future web-publishing app, and Apple Pages owns the
word-processor association. `shelf`/`library` — weaker than vault, and library
reads as "code library" to this audience.

**Note on the crowded namespace:** several unrelated SaaS products are called
Bento (email automation, link-in-bio, analytics, a dead FileMaker database).
The field is crowded, which weakens everyone's claim — including ours. The
practical cost is discoverability, not legal exposure. Mitigation is the
`bento/<app>` form, the `bento.page` domain, and always carrying the
descriptor. Get real clearance before commercialising; a bare wordmark would
be hard to register, a composite (mark + logo) much less so.

## 2026-07-25 — bento/vault is a personal server; the relay is a separate product
**Supersedes the "map, not the keys" entry below.** Vault is not an index and
not a sync service — it is "cloud services without a cloud": your documents
live on hardware you own (desktop / NAS / homelab) and it provides
reachability, search, cross-document references and version history without
any of it running on someone else's computer. The closer reference is
Tailscale, not Dropbox.

Vault and the **relay** are separate products with separate release trains.
The relay is dumb infrastructure — rendezvous, an optional encrypted
dead-drop, presence, nothing else — hosted on Cloudflare for the masses and
self-hosted by serious users. Every actual service runs on the personal
server; if the hosted relay ever accretes features, self-hosting becomes
second-class and we lose the audience this is for.

Consequences: the relay needs a portable
(Docker) implementation because the current Worker+DO+hibernation stack is not
realistically self-hostable; independent release trains require a versioned
capability handshake (we can no longer control deploy order); background
execution is unreliable on every platform so the protocol must be correct
after unbounded offline periods; mobile uses iOS File Provider /
Android DocumentsProvider rather than a background daemon; and the agent syncs
a FOLDER, so no Bento app needs any changes. Retained from the superseded
entry: the relay only ever sees ciphertext, and **export-to-standalone-file
always works** — that invariant is what keeps "your data is a file you own"
true while vault holds it.

## 2026-07-24 — [SUPERSEDED] bento/vault holds the map, not the keys
The document library must not become a custody service. It stores an encrypted
index of what documents exist and how they reference each other; each document
keeps its own encryption password and collab credentials. Compromising the
vault reveals *what you have*, not what is in it, and losing the vault loses an
index, not your work. This preserves the property that makes the relay
defensible — files stay authoritative, server loss is survivable — and keeps
the name an honest promise. Any sync tier is E2EE and optional (DO for
coordination + R2 for encrypted blobs; never D1/plaintext), and self-hostable.

## 2026-07-24 — Suite expansion: bento/spaces and bento/dash
Two new apps begin: **bento/spaces** (Notion/notes-like) and **bento/dash**
(spreadsheet + tables). Development fans out across parallel
agents and multiple tools (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity) — coordination
rules in `docs/PARALLEL-WORK.md`, platform contract in `docs/PLATFORM.md`.
Planned pre-fan-out groundwork: extract the shared kernel (monorepo layout,
apps beside `slides/`), add per-PR CI validation gates (typecheck +
build:single + splice conformance + test-sync). Releases stay local/signed
regardless of CI.

## 2026-07-24 — Hold marketing-surface i18n
Don't localize the bento.page landing page or README yet: the landing page
will be rebuilt around the multi-app suite, so translations now would only
drift. App UI i18n (7 locales) is the localization that matters and already
ships. Revisit once the new landing page is stable.

## 2026-07-24 — No bot/AI-agent identities in git history
External PRs get provenance review before merge (`gh api users/<login>`);
scatter-bot/AI-agent contributions are declined. A bot's merged PR was
scrubbed from history via filter-repo + force-push, and `main` is now
branch-protected (1 required review, no force-pushes). Human contributors'
authorship is preserved normally.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.0.7 launch (Show HN) and post-launch fixes
Launched publicly (#1 on HN, ~1000 pts). Post-launch priorities were driven
by thread feedback: collab focus-steal fix, chart zero-baseline for negative
values, mobile-Safari pinch, reduce-motion mode — all shipped in v1.0.8
alongside panel UI for community format features (text gradient, text-stroke,
blur/blend, backdrop-filter). Community format features are accepted when
additive + composable (unknown fields preserved; effects compose).

## v1.0.7 — Morph identity decoupled from element id
Elements carry optional `morphId` overriding the morph pairing;
`data-flip-id = morphId || id`. `id` stays the stable identity (selection,
anchors, CRDT). Chosen over mutating ids, which would have broken comment
anchors and collab node identity. Details: CLAUDE.md (render.ts section).

## v0.9.x — Charts are in-house (ECharts removed)
ECharts was 630KB (~47% of the shell); replaced with charts-lite interpreting
the same option SHAPE (pure JSON, no functions). Exotic configs degrade
gracefully rather than crash. Don't re-add a chart dependency; extend
charts-lite instead. Details: CLAUDE.md (charts section).

## v0.9.x — Collab credentials mint-at-creation, dormant until shared
Decks are born collab-capable but never auto-connect unless the doc arrived
carrying collab or the user opted in — fresh templates/demos must never phone
home. Read-only and writer roles are enforced cryptographically at the blind
relay, not honour-system. Spec: docs/collab-design.md.

## v0.x — Releases are cut locally, never in CI
The signing key never leaves the maintainer's machine; the signed bytes are
the served bytes. CI may validate (typecheck/build/gates) but never signs,
publishes, or deploys. Runbook: docs/RELEASING.md.

## v0.x — Single-file architecture is the product
One HTML file = document + viewer + editor, working offline from file://.
The splice contract on `#bento-doc` is frozen forever (shipped updaters
depend on it). Everything else is negotiable; this isn't. See
docs/PLATFORM.md §1–2.

## 2026-07-25 — Large assets travel out-of-band; the relay stays blind

Assets over 64KB (`BLOB_INLINE_MAX`) no longer ride inside CRDT ops. They are
encrypted client-side, uploaded once to the relay's R2 bucket, and referenced
from the document by a content-addressed key; peers fetch and decrypt on
receipt. This was forced by measurement, not preference: Durable Object storage
values cap at ~2MB, so the previous inline path produced frames the relay
accepted-then-dropped, and the client re-sent forever. Details and threat model
in `docs/blob-offload.md`.

Three properties are load-bearing and must not be traded away:

- **The relay cannot read a blob.** It pipes ciphertext without buffering. The
  key is `HMAC(roomKey, sha256(plaintext))`, so identical bytes dedupe *within*
  a room and are unlinkable *across* rooms — a plain content hash would have
  let the relay confirm two rooms hold the same file.
- **R2 is optional.** Absent binding = `/b/` answers 501, clients inline small
  assets and same-origin tabs still resolve from the local cache. A
  self-hoster without a bucket degrades; they are not broken. This follows
  from the relay being dumb infrastructure (see the vault entry).
- **Failures are visible, never silent-but-wrong.** An unresolved blob leaves
  the asset absent and renders empty rather than blank-looking-fine. The whole
  change set exists because the old failure mode was invisible.

Operational consequence: the relay must be deployed **before** a client that
depends on the blob endpoints — the standing rule for this split, same as the
keepalive and access-verification changes.

## 2026-07-25 — Solo review model: PR + green CI, zero required approvals

**Amends the entry below** ("Every PR gets human review before merging"). The
intent stands — every change lands via PR and the maintainer reads it — but the
*mechanism* was wrong and was quietly defeating the CI gate.

`main` required 1 approving review. GitHub forbids approving your own PR, so on
a one-person project that requirement is unsatisfiable and **every** merge had
to use `--admin`. Admin bypass skips *all* branch protection, including the
required `validate` status check. Net effect: the CI gate was decorative, and a
red build could land on `main` with nothing to stop it.

Now: `required_approving_review_count: 0`, PRs still required, `validate` still
a required status check, force-pushes and deletions still blocked. A normal
`gh pr merge` works and genuinely cannot merge a red build. Admin bypass stays
*available* (`enforce_admins: false`) but is now an exception rather than the
daily path — if you find yourself reaching for `--admin`, that is a signal
something is actually failing.

Human review is a practice, not a GitHub setting, for as long as the team is
one person. Restore a real approval count the moment a second reviewer exists;
the future-action exclusion list in the amended entry still applies.

## RTL is two separable problems; only one of them is the document's

**Decided:** 2026-07-26. Supersedes nothing; establishes the split.

Content bidi and chrome mirroring get confused constantly, and treating them
as one feature produces the wrong answer to both.

*Content* direction is a correctness bug and belongs to the document: an
Arabic sentence puts its full stop in the wrong place without `dir="auto"`,
and it is wrong for everyone who opens the file. Cheap, uncontroversial, do it.

*Chrome* mirroring is a UI convention. Nothing is incorrect without it; the
editor merely feels foreign to an RTL reader. It was deliberately sequenced
AFTER an RTL language pack existed, because mirroring a UI whose every label
is still English is worse than not mirroring — and because the point of
shipping a pack first is to learn whether RTL users actually turn up.

The invariant that falls out of the split — **the document never mirrors** —
is recorded in `PLATFORM.md` §8 and binds every Bento app. A document that
looks different depending on the viewer's locale is a format-level bug.

Cost, measured rather than guessed: ~430 bytes in the shipped shell for the
whole chrome conversion, and **zero** for the languages themselves, because
every RTL language is a pack. Size was never the constraint here. The real
constraint is that 32 of the editor's ~36 direction-adjacent coordinate sites
live in `canvas.ts` (Moveable/Selecto), which cannot be verified by an agent —
synthetic drags on Moveable handles do not register at all. Pinning the
document surfaces LTR was sufficient to leave that math untouched, and that is
the outcome to preserve: if a future change makes chrome direction reach
`canvas.ts`, stop and reconsider rather than refactoring the coordinate code.

**No plural system.** Hebrew (and later Arabic) ship without one. Of 15
count-bearing strings only 6 take a real count; the rest are index labels
(`Axis {n}`, `slide {n}`) or abbreviated times. Six strings do not justify
changing the catalog format, the build script, the CI gate and every catalog.
Translators phrase them count-agnostically instead (`מחוברים: {n}`), which is
standard practice when a framework lacks plurals and costs nothing at runtime.
Revisit only if a language arrives where the workaround genuinely fails.

## One English word, two meanings = two keys

**Decided:** 2026-07-26. Consequence of English-string-as-key; binds every
Bento app that uses `kernel/src/i18n.ts`.

Gettext-style catalogs key on the English source string, which quietly assumes
that one English word means one thing. It often doesn't. `Loop` was the
animation loop AND the media playback toggle; `solid` was a fill style AND a
line style. Every language had to pick one word and be wrong in the other
place — Swedish wants *enfärgad* for a solid colour and *heldragen* for a
solid line, and no amount of translator care fixes that from inside the
catalog. Both were found independently by pack authors, which is the signal:
if a translator has to ask "which one is this?", the key is broken, not them.

**The rule.** When one English string reaches `t()` from two call sites that
mean different things, the more specific site takes a QUALIFIED key
(`Loop animation`, `solid colour`) and the plainer one keeps the bare word.
Do not add a context-prefix convention — the key is also what English users
read, so it has to be a sentence, not `fill.solid`.

**Model words never move.** Values like `solid`/`gradient` are format words
stored in the document. Disambiguate the LABEL only: `labeledSelect()` takes
`[value, label]` pairs precisely so the displayed string and the stored string
can diverge. A "fix" that changes what is written to `doc` is a format change
wearing an i18n costume.

**The cost, so it is paid deliberately.** Re-keying invalidates that entry in
every bundled catalog AND in every pack, silently — the string simply falls
back to English. So it happens BEFORE packs are published, in one PR, with
the affected keys listed for pack authors to pick up. After packs ship,
re-keying is a coordinated break across every language and should be weighed
against living with a slightly wrong word.

**Interpolated values are strings too.** `t('This {kind} is…', { kind })` with
a model word for `kind` puts an English noun inside a translated sentence.
Localise at the call site (`{ kind: t(kind) }`) — and check the sentence still
agrees grammatically, since a substituted noun carries gender in half the
languages we ship (French needed "Ce fichier {kind}" once `vidéo` could land
in it).

## 2026-07-26 — bento/tray: the iOS host is a suite member, and it is generic

The native iOS app is named **bento/tray** — "Bento Tray" on the App Store,
bundle id `page.bento.tray`, source in `tray/` beside `slides/` and `spaces/`.

**It runs ANY self-contained HTML document, not only Bento's.** That is not
scope creep bolted on; the Swift never parses the document and never did — it
is a courier that serves bytes into a WKWebView and polyfills the one File
System Access call the page needs to save itself. Bento decks are simply the
first documents it carries. Any single-file HTML app that saves itself works
identically, which on iOS is otherwise impossible: every browser there is
WebKit and none ship that API.

Naming notes, so this is not relitigated:

- **`bento/host` was rejected.** It names the mechanism, not the thing, and the
  suite convention is `bento/<what you get>`. "tray" keeps the food metaphor and
  says what it does — a tray carries any bento, whoever made it.
- **Plain "Bento" is unavailable** on the App Store: an unrelated Food & Drink
  app holds the exact name, and App Store names are globally unique. "Bento
  Tray" and "BentoTray" were both free at time of checking. That check reads
  published listings only — reservations in App Store Connect are invisible to
  it, so confirm there before submitting.
- The App Store name carries no slash. Per the 2026-07-24 naming entry, `/` is
  a mark, never a stored name.

**One app, not two.** A separate "generic HTML runner" listing would risk
guideline 4.3 (duplicate apps from one developer) and doubles the listing
overhead — screenshots, privacy labels, review cycles — for no gain. The
Developer Program is $99/yr per ACCOUNT, so a second app costs nothing in fees;
the cost is entirely in maintenance.

Consequence already implemented: each document gets its OWN origin
(`bento-tray://<sha256 of path>`), because a shared origin would let one
document read another's localStorage and IndexedDB — tolerable when every file
is yours, a real leak between unrelated third-party apps.
