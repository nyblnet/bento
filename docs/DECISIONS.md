# Decision log

Append-only. Newest first. One entry per settled decision that a parallel
agent (or future session) might otherwise re-open or contradict. Keep entries
to a few lines: **what** was decided, **why**, and where the details live.
Reversing a decision = a new entry that supersedes the old one, not an edit.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — Title
Decision. Why. Pointers.

## 2026-07-24 — Suite expansion: Bento Spaces and Bento Dash
Two new apps begin: **Bento Spaces** (Notion/notes-like) and **Bento Dash**
(data/spreadsheet). Names provisional. Development fans out across parallel
agents and multiple tools (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity) — coordination
rules in `docs/PARALLEL-WORK.md`, platform contract in `docs/PLATFORM.md`.
Planned pre-fan-out groundwork: extract the shared kernel (monorepo layout,
apps beside `slides/`), add per-PR CI validation gates (typecheck +
build:single + splice conformance + test-sync). Releases stay local/signed
regardless of CI.

## 2026-07-24 — Hold marketing-surface i18n
Don't localize the bento.page landing page or README yet: the landing page
will be rebuilt around the multi-app suite, so translations now would only
drift. App UI i18n (7 locales) is the localization that matters and already
ships. Revisit once the new landing page is stable.

## 2026-07-24 — No bot/AI-agent identities in git history
External PRs get provenance review before merge (`gh api users/<login>`);
scatter-bot/AI-agent contributions are declined. A bot's merged PR was
scrubbed from history via filter-repo + force-push, and `main` is now
branch-protected (1 required review, no force-pushes). Human contributors'
authorship is preserved normally.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.0.7 launch (Show HN) and post-launch fixes
Launched publicly (#1 on HN, ~1000 pts). Post-launch priorities were driven
by thread feedback: collab focus-steal fix, chart zero-baseline for negative
values, mobile-Safari pinch, reduce-motion mode — all shipped in v1.0.8
alongside panel UI for community format features (text gradient, text-stroke,
blur/blend, backdrop-filter). Community format features are accepted when
additive + composable (unknown fields preserved; effects compose).

## v1.0.7 — Morph identity decoupled from element id
Elements carry optional `morphId` overriding the morph pairing;
`data-flip-id = morphId || id`. `id` stays the stable identity (selection,
anchors, CRDT). Chosen over mutating ids, which would have broken comment
anchors and collab node identity. Details: CLAUDE.md (render.ts section).

## v0.9.x — Charts are in-house (ECharts removed)
ECharts was 630KB (~47% of the shell); replaced with charts-lite interpreting
the same option SHAPE (pure JSON, no functions). Exotic configs degrade
gracefully rather than crash. Don't re-add a chart dependency; extend
charts-lite instead. Details: CLAUDE.md (charts section).

## v0.9.x — Collab credentials mint-at-creation, dormant until shared
Decks are born collab-capable but never auto-connect unless the doc arrived
carrying collab or the user opted in — fresh templates/demos must never phone
home. Read-only and writer roles are enforced cryptographically at the blind
relay, not honour-system. Spec: docs/collab-design.md.

## v0.x — Releases are cut locally, never in CI
The signing key never leaves the maintainer's machine; the signed bytes are
the served bytes. CI may validate (typecheck/build/gates) but never signs,
publishes, or deploys. Runbook: docs/RELEASING.md.

## v0.x — Single-file architecture is the product
One HTML file = document + viewer + editor, working offline from file://.
The splice contract on `#bento-doc` is frozen forever (shipped updaters
depend on it). Everything else is negotiable; this isn't. See
docs/PLATFORM.md §1–2.
