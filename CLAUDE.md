# Bento — self-contained office documents

One HTML file = the document + viewer + editor. See `README.md` for the vision.
`slides/` is the first app (PowerPoint replacement); docs and sheets come later.

## Architecture (slides/)

- `src/model.ts` — the `bento/slides` JSON document model + starter deck. This is the format.
- `src/save.ts` — the self-save trick: clone the document at boot (`capturePristine`),
  swap the `#bento-doc` data block, re-serialize. JSON is `<`-escaped (`<`) so it can
  never contain `</script>`. File System Access API first, download fallback.
- `src/render.ts` — single model→DOM renderer shared by editor canvas, thumbnails, and
  Reveal sections. Elements carry `data-el-id` (editing) and `data-flip-id` (morph).
- `src/present.ts` — Reveal.js overlay; slides with `transition:'morph'` use GSAP Flip:
  matched `data-flip-id` elements animate geometry via Flip, style props (fill/color)
  tween straight from the model values. Elements can carry `fx` (enter stagger,
  countUp, ken-burns ambient) and `link` (click → jump to slide id) — both run only
  in present mode; the editor ignores them (no UI yet).
- `src/editor/` — vanilla-TS editor. Moveable + Selecto handle manipulation.

## Hard-won details — do not regress

1. **Moveable in a scaled canvas**: the control box mounts INSIDE `.ed-stage-scale`
   (the `transform: scale()` wrapper) with `rootContainer: document.body`, and
   `moveable.zoom = 1/scale` on relayout. Then all Moveable event coords are in
   slide-local px. Mounting it outside the scaled wrapper gives garbage coordinates.
2. **Don't reset `moveable.target` to an identical array** — gesture listeners re-attach
   a frame later and a drag started in that frame is swallowed (`syncTargets` checks).
3. **`querySelector('[data-el-id=…]')` is ambiguous** — sidebar thumbnails contain the
   same ids as the canvas. Always scope to the surface (`.ed-stage-scale …`).
4. **Never let a literal `</script>` into the bundle** — `save.ts` builds it by
   concatenation; the data block JSON escapes `<`.
5. Reveal's `.reveal-viewport` paints white; the present overlay CSS overrides it black.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` (in slides/) — dev server; `.claude/launch.json` has `slides-dev` (:5199)
  and `serve-built` (:5198, serves dist-single).
- `npm run build:single` — the shippable `dist-single/Bento_Slides.bento.html`.
- In-page scripting/testing API: `window.bento` → `{ doc, serialize() }`.

## Testing gotcha

Synthetic `PointerEvent`s do NOT trigger Moveable/Selecto (Gesto listens for mouse
events) — dispatch `MouseEvent`s, or use trusted input. After changing selection, wait a
frame before starting a synthetic drag.
